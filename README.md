<i><b>This is the project I decided to make with the start of 2025 and will complete this project by the end of 2025</b>.</i>
<h3>To Start with the main.py -</h3>
<li> You need to first enter the detail of video for e.g. location,name,etc. Try syntax - video
<li> You need to paste the URL(s) of specific video. 
<li> Your downloading will start
<li> Don't get panic if you see a lot of processing in the terminal
<li> To open the video in VLC, you need to run the file in IDLE Python
<li> To open the file in Windows Media Player, you can run on any interpreter.
<h4><I>NOTE:</I> It downloads in 360p only with Audio because youtube provide audio and video in the media only with 360p but I'll fix this bug. Please, keep patience!!!</h4>
<h5><u>Update 1: </u>Added more Configurations to the Configuring dictionary - TIME - 02:35 AM 05-01-2025</h5>
