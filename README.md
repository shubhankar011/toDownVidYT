# 🎥 toDownVidYT
### Creator & Author — **Shubhankar Kumar**

> *“A project I began at the start of 2025 to explore YouTube video processing, backend scripting, and web-based automation using Python. Over time, it evolved from a CLI downloader into a full Flask web application with modular design and UI.”*

## 🧩 Overview
**toDownVidYT** is a two-part Python project designed to download YouTube videos or audio with full control over format, naming, and storage — first as a **command-line tool**, later expanded into a **web-based Flask interface**.

It uses **yt-dlp** as the core downloading engine and **FFmpeg** for postprocessing and format conversion.

## Quick Start Guide

### Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
Install FFmpeg

Download FFmpeg 7.1 or newer and add it to your system PATH.
Verify with:

ffmpeg -version
Run CLI Version
bash
cd CLI
python main_02.py


You’ll be asked to:

Enter a YouTube video URL

Select format and download directory

Enter an optional filename

CLI version also prints available formats and real-time progress directly in the terminal.

Run Web Version

cd WEB-based
python app.py


Then open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000


Paste a YouTube link, choose your format, and click Download.
Files will appear inside the /downloads folder.
Playback Options

To open automatically in VLC:

pip install python-vlc


Run the CLI version using IDLE Python.

For Windows Media Player, run from any interpreter — works automatically.

 Technical Notes

Uses yt-dlp for extraction, handling DASH streams, and FFmpeg merging.

FFmpeg performs .webm → .mp4 conversion (takes ~1–2 minutes for HD).

Subtitles can be embedded if available (writesubtitles=True).

Cookie support (optional): add a cookies.txt next to main_02.py.
